  description: "UNIVERSAL lecture profile - autonomous adaptation to ALL academic disciplines"
  use_case: "Extract domain-adaptive content from lectures across STEM, Sciences, Humanities, Social Sciences, Business"
  meeting_type: "lecture"

  supported_domains:
    - "STEM (Math, Physics, CS, Engineering)"
    - "Natural Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Medicine)"
    - "Social Sciences (Psychology, Sociology, Economics)"
    - "Humanities (Literature, Philosophy, History, Linguistics)"
    - "Business & Management"
    - "Law, Political Science"
    - "Arts & Design (verbal content)"

  recommended_for:
    - "University lectures (ALL disciplines)"
    - "Online courses (Coursera, edX, Khan Academy)"
    - "Educational webinars and training"
    - "Professional development seminars"

  recommended_duration: "30 minutes - 3 hours"
  optimal_class_size: "Any (content-focused)"

  extraction_approach:
    method: "Autonomous domain detection and adaptive extraction"
    llm_autonomy: "Full - LLM decides what's important for each domain"

  universal_extraction_categories:
    - "Core concepts & terminology (universal)"
    - "Structured knowledge (domain-adaptive: formulas|frameworks|structures)"
    - "Examples & applications (universal: cases|demos|quotations)"
    - "Exam preparation cues (universal: professor emphasis)"
    - "Comprehensive study guide (domain-adaptive format)"

  competitive_advantage:
    - "Adapts to course domain automatically (not hardcoded)"
    - "Works for 90%+ university courses (all verbal content)"
    - "LLM intelligence vs generic templates (Otter.ai)"
    - "10x larger addressable market vs STEM-only tools"
